Output Format

mov - minimum number of operations to be performed to change the initial array to the desired array.

Sample Input 0

3
16 16 16
Sample Output 0

7
Explanation 0

The initial state of the array is [0,0,0].

Now we increment all the elements by 1. 

Now the array is changed to [1,1,1]. No of moves takes = 3.

Now we double the array 4 times.

The array is changed as follows,

    [1,1,1]->[2,2,2]->[4,4,4]->[8,8,8]->[16,16,16].

No. of moves taken => 3+4 = 7.
Sample Input 1

2
2 3
Sample Output 1

4
Explanation 1

The initial state is [0,0].

We increment each element by 1 and double the array.

The array changes as follow => [0,0] -> [1,0] -> [1,1] -> [2,2].

Now we increment the 2nd element alone.

[2,2]->[2,3].

Total number of moves taken = 4.
