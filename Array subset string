Given 2 arrays A and B of m and n words. Each word is a string of lowercase letters. Now, say that all words in array B is a subset of which words in array A.

For Example,

Both "pe" and "il" are subsets of "pencil" whereas "wrr" is a subset of "warrior" but not a subset of "world".

Print every word in array A,for which every word in array b is a subset. If there is no such word in array A, print -1.

Input Format

m,n - size of array A and B

m words of array A

n word of array B

Constraints

1<=m,n<=10

Output Format

Array of words

Consider every word in array A:
amazon - has 'o' but not 'e'
apple - has 'e' but not 'o'
facebook - has both 'e' and 'o'
google - has both 'e' and 'o'
leetcode - has both 'e' and 'o'

hence output is 'facebook,google,leetcode'
